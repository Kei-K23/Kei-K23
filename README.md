My name is Arkar Min and I'm a Software Engineer/AI Engineer. I'm passionate about solid engineering, solving the problems, designing Distributed Systems, AI/ML and building LLM applications.

I have strong working experiences in various domains and sectors including **Developing Streaming & Entertainment systems**, **E-commerces**, **LMS, CRM, CMS, ERP systems** and **working and integrating with LLM**. In my free time, I do open-source contributions, exploring new tech & trends in the software development and AI/ML landscape, learning new skills and building open-source projects and sometimes freelancing. 

Apart from Software Development and Programming, I like weight lifting and learning natural languages.
