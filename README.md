  Hello there 👋, I'm Arkar Min (Kei-K)
</h1>

- A passionate software developer 🧑‍💻 interested in building CLI, crafting tools 🛠️ and building full-stack web applications 🕸️.
- I'm fascinating about low level system programming, microservices, compilers, interpreters and building things from scratch 🚀.
- Now, I am learning `Rust`, compilers and low-level concepts like memory management.
- Languages and Frameworks agnostic. I'm working with various languages, frameworks and tools.
- I work as a full stack developer and in my day to day job I build full-stack web applications both front-end and back-end. I work with React, NextJS, Node, JavaScript, AWS services and microservices architecture. Apart from full-time job, I'm actively doing side projects and open-source works in here ([GitHub](https://github.com/Kei-K23)).
- I have beautiful girlfriend, K 💙.
